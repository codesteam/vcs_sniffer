More specific support checks is provided below.\r\n\r\n* PHP syntax check.\r\n* PHP coding standard check (we use [PHPCodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer)).\r\n* ruby syntax check.\r\n* ruby coding standard check (we use [rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)).\r\n\r\n### Usage as hg extension\r\nYou can use `VSC_sniffer` as hg extension. For example, if you were to run\r\n```\r\n$ mkdir ~/.hgext/vcs_sniffer\r\n$ cd ~/.hgext/vcs_sniffer\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:codesteam/vcs_sniffer.git .\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then add this lines into your `hgrc` config:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[extensions]\r\nvcs_sniffer = ~/.hgext/vcs_sniffer/vcs_sniffer\r\n```\r\nand then when you will commit into `hg` file with invalid PHP syntax it will give you something like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
